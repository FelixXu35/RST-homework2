function squreRoot = Mysqrt(originalNum)
%Mysqrt - calculates the squre root of a non-negative positive real number
%
% Syntax: squreRoot = Mysqrt(originalNum)
%
% This function calculates the square root of a non-negative positive real number iteratively by using the Babylonian method:
% 1.Start with an arbitrary number y (e.g., 1).
% 2.Replace y by (y + x/y)/2
% 3.Repeat the process until the new y differs from the old one by less than 12*eps (i.e.|y_new â€“ y_old|/y_new < 12*eps)
